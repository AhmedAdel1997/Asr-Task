# All Translations must be in File 'assets/translations/'

- First of all do not type in file [locale_keys.g.dart](mdc:lib/src/config/language/locale_keys.g.dart) ever
- add this line in imports
    import '../../../../config/language/locale_keys.g.dart' show LocaleKeys;
- find all titles in the screen
- For Exmaple:
    -name : Ahmed
    -age : 28 years
    name and age are titles , ahmed and 28 years are values
- only translate title and implement values as it is
- translate title in english then go to file [lang.json](mdc:assets/translations/lang.json)
- add a new key and value to the current map in the file [lang.json](mdc:assets/translations/lang.json)
- the key is the english translation without any special character and the value is the arabic translation
- do not modify any existing key in the already existing map
- use the translations in file like
    For Example:
    if you add a new key and value in [lang.json](mdc:assets/translations/lang.json) like this
    "Hello how are you":"مرحبا كيف حالك",
    to access the new translation, you need to call LocaleKeys.helloHowAreYou 
- neglect .tr() as it is not important anymore
